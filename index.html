    <p>My name is Patrick Blanchard. I was born here in Chicago and
        spent most of my childhood in Glenview just north of the city.
        I am in my fourth year at IIT and major in Consumer research.
        IIT has actually gotten rid of this major since I got to school
        so most people have usually never heard of it. Outside of school
        I spend most of my time playing basketball as I play here at IIT, 
        so that is a huge part of my life.
