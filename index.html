    <h1>ITMD 441 Intro</h1>
    <div style="color:blue;">About Me</div>
        <p>My name is Patrick Blanchard. I was born here in Chicago and
        spent most of my childhood in Glenview just north of the city.
        I am in my fourth year at IIT and major in Consumer research.
        IIT has actually gotten rid of this major since I got to school
        so most people have usually never heard of it. Outside of school
        I spend most of my time playing basketball as I play here at IIT, 
        so that is a huge part of my life.
        </p>
    <div style="color:blue;">My ITMD Experience</div>
        <p>I am excited for this class. I have always enjoyed website
            development specifically using Git and Github despite my limited
            experience. It is because I know I have a lot to learn that I look
            forward to this course.
        </p>
